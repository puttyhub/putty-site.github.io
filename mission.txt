The technology of webcams and publicity—
there’s now one camera for every four citizens,
and they’re posted in public places.
They’re monitoring people, and even, at times, they’re using children's voices.
They catch someone on one of these mounted cameras throwing a cigarette butt in the street,
and the voice of a child comes on, saying,
"You shouldn’t do that, you know. You’re littering. Now you pick that up."
And there’s public shaming going on—
this is worse than being in the stocks, or having a scarlet letter on your front.
Now, online, everybody knows everything about you—
it’s a totally different world—
the context in which we feel good and bad.
This leads people to hide more, because they’re afraid if they expose one thing,
they’ll expose everything.

The young man lights a cigarette with the hand wearing the latex glove, holding an iPhone in the ungloved hand.
He takes a deep drag, lighting the cigarette, and blows out a huge puff of feel-good smoke.
Pain feels so good; the hole inside all of us aches, and addiction artificially fills that ache.

There are three broad spirits in which American television portrays the rich: aspiration, judgment, and reassurance. The aspirational spirit makes you long for what they have—success, beauty, and the high-gloss sheen of socially ordained insanity. The judgmental spirit offers retribution, condemning them for how they got it, while hinting at reparations owed to ancestral debts. And the reassuring spirit tells you, with a knowing smile, that you don’t want what they have, anyway—because longing is harder to live with than absence.

Western view on animals / pets:
 In many Western cultures, pets—especially dogs and cats—are seen as family members. There's a strong emphasis on animal rights, emotional bonding, and individualized care. Companion animals are often anthropomorphized, with high spending on their well-being, diets, healthcare, and even fashion.
Chinese view on animals / pets:
In much of Chinese tradition and modern practice, animals are regarded as functional biological machine-slaves, harvested for nourishment, labor, and material use. They are not seen as possessing souls, rights, or inner lives, but rather as units of utility—bred, confined, and killed to serve human ends. Whether in wet markets, industrial farms, or laboratories, the prevailing view treats animals not as companions or moral subjects, but as resources to be extracted and optimized.

### Image 2 (Reexamined)

There is a human with long dark hair. The face is symmetrical, smooth, and mostly still. One half is visible in soft light. The other half is covered in shadow, nearly erased. The skin is medium-dark. The lips are closed. The eye is steady, possibly watching, possibly remembering. There is no obvious age. The body has no clear markers of category but leans slightly toward softness. The clothing and space are undistinguished—without color, without time.

**Impression:**  
This being exists in two states—**seen and hidden**. The choice to show only half the face may suggest the being is **not whole here**, or that wholeness requires both concealment and exposure. The light does not reach fully. The being may not expect it to.

The skin, hair, and features suggest this being is **not the same kind** as the figure in the first image. Perhaps it comes from a different lineage. Perhaps it is treated differently. It does not mimic anything. It does not glow.

The face appears to carry **memory**, but not expression. This being may carry more than is visible, but **no part of it escapes the stillness**. It is intact, yet in retreat.

---

### National Identity (from this image alone):

This place appears to generate beings who are **partially visible**, who are asked to remain still while **vanishing slowly**. There is **depth**, but no invitation to reveal it. The beings here might be **present but conditional**—allowed to exist only in **fractions**.

The image suggests a kind

OZ3D – Scene Fragment / Shot List Text
TITLE CARD
 OZ3D: An American Fairytale of Heat, Steel, and Flesh
FADE IN:
INT. CENTRAL OBSERVATION HUB — NIGHT
The Control Room glows with surveillance screens. A FAT WARDEN picks beef jerky from his teeth while watching grainy footage of dancing children. A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL in clown makeup is held down on foam mats, fighting to eat her sweater.
WIZARD (V.O.)
 In the heart of the Zone, they watch from glass towers. The girls are flowers. The boys are iron.

CHARACTER INTRO SEQUENCE – THE BOYS OF THE BRICK WARD
EDUARDO THE DEADPAN
 Staring at the floor. Given a plastic bag and set loose with no script.
 GUARD (flat):
 Time to go, kid.


EDUARDO (barely audible):
 What’s this?
GUARD:
 All you’ve got. You’re free.
He steps out into the courtyard. Razor wire glints in the sun. The wind carries the smell of wet concrete and Old Spice.

MUTE PUMP
 A NATIVE TEEN with an improvised gym: water jug dumbbells, broom handle barbell, sock-wrapped wrists. He lifts patiently, laughing to himself. He’s shirtless, eyes glowing.


WIZARD (V.O.)
 He didn’t speak much. But his body knew the language of war.

THE PERV-KID
 A feral trickster with pink Crocs. He lunges at a girl. MUTE PUMP smashes him into the wall. Staff intervene.


WITCH (O.S., whispering):
 Every tale needs a devil. Even the angels get dirty here.

THE ROOM OF AMERICA


We see:
A BALD EAGLE picking apart hotdog scraps on a landfill.


A MAN IN A DUMP UNIFORM compacts trash into glowing cubes.


A FLAG flaps over an abandoned Denny’s.



EXT. GATE TO NEW ATLANTIS — DUSK
Eduardo walks alone through an electrified gate labeled “ZONE EXIT.” A drone buzzes overhead. The sun bleeds across the sky.
WIZARD (V.O.)
 They said New Atlantis was the last place where people could dance. So he walked. Bag in hand. Muscles like myths. Eyes set on the horizon.
CUT TO BLACK.

CHARACTER KEY / ARCHETYPES FOR OZ3D
Eduardo → The Golem-Boy — animated by state neglect, soul in stasis.


Mute Pump → Atlas Minor — bearer of invisible weights.


Perv-Kid → The Trickster-Wound — chaos engine, necessary evil.


The Fat Warden → The Crooked Mirror — watcher of all, changer of none.


The Control Room → The Tower of Surveillance Angels — where they name the nameless.


Prompt for above = ok this is a good start , lets try on where we use some of these characters too 

OZ3D is a 21st-century fairytale, a story celebrating American freedom and American values. A tale of renewal, it tells the story of the dreams of the mystics with the iron conviction of those who shape history. OZ3D invites audiences to rediscover a realm where tiny becomes enormous, where cold meets hot, and dry meets wet. 

The wizard: 
Dorthy Hamburger: 
Witch: the Egregores: 
The Fizz 

I have some inspiration that might work for OZ3D - I'm curious what you think about using the children from the juvenile psych lockup I worked at as character inspiration Watching the children in make up dancing made me think of that... .

The guard's footsteps echoed down the hallway, growing louder with each passing moment. Eduardo didn't react, didn't even flinch. He just sat there, staring blankly into space. 

The guard stopped in front of Eduardo's cell, looked down at him with a mixture of disdain and pity. "Time to go, kid," he said, his voice firm but not unkind. 

The group is headed to the city of New Atlantis, a fabled metropolis that's said to be the last bastion of freedom in a world that's rapidly descending into chaos. 

Hmm maybe, I think my intuition is more about the American experience - there was this central control room that one of the workers would be in and it had all the cameras in each child's room. 

I have an image of my fat boss sitting there watching me and a coworker while we physically restrain a 14 year old girl from eating her sweater for 4 hours But then now I also see the man pushing trash into cubes at the dump and a bald eagle. 

There is pride in the simple things, red blood Americana 

1:07 PM Christopher Hunt 
There was this native kid in there too who was super cool. He was mostly non verbal, he was in there because he beat another high schooler to a pulp. 

But he would spend most of his time sitting in the corner laughing and he was all about weight lifting. 

The staff let him build his own weight set out of broom sticks and jugs of water and he would just hang out patiently waiting for his time with the weight jugs 

Sometimes the kid who was in the system since he was 6 who would always try molesting people would start shoving his ball sweat covered hand in his face or he make a pass at one of the girls and we would have to intervene and make sure he didn't beat the crap out of the perv kid I wonder whatever happened to him, he turned 18 when I was there and they just released them once they turn 18.

 I gave him a book about body building before he left. 

Eduardo didn't respond. He just stood up, his movements mechanical and stiff. The guard handed him a small bag with some clothes and a few personal belongings. 

"What's this?" Eduardo asked, his voice barely above a whisper. 

"It's all you've got," the guard replied. "You're on your own now." Eduardo took the bag, his eyes scanning the contents. 

He didn't react, didn't show any emotion. He just stood there, frozen in time.

 The guard nodded, turned, and walked away. Eduardo watched him go, his eyes following the guard's retreating back. 

The cell door creaked open, and Eduardo stepped out into the bright sunlight. He blinked, his eyes adjusting slowly to the light. He looked around, taking in his surroundings. 

He was in a small, drab courtyard, surrounded by high walls and barbed wire. A single gate led out into the unknown. Eduardo took a deep breath, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over him. 

He had no idea what lay ahead, no idea what the future held. He took a step forward, his eyes fixed on the gate. He took another step, and another, his feet carrying him forward into the unknown. 

The gate creaked shut behind him, and Eduardo was gone, left to face whatever lay ahead.

The Iroquois Confederacy and Its Influence
The Iroquois Confederacy was a sophisticated alliance of six nations—the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora—governed by the Great Law ofPeace. This constitution emphasized principles like federalism, participatory governance, and consensus decision-making. Notably, it featured a council of representatives from each nation, checks and balances, and the ability to remove leaders—a structure that paralleled aspects of the U.S. Constitution

In China, he told me, “you can think and pretty much say whatever you want.” He may have sensed my skepticism, given the country’s record of imprisoning critics and detaining ethnic minorities in concentration camps. “If you want to organize against the government, you’re gonna have problems,” he admitted. [...] “Not Stalin problems. You’ll just, like, be cancelled.”

For certain people, like meth addicts or four-year-olds, Yarvin said, too much freedom could be deadly. Then, gesturing to the homeless population camped in the neighborhood, he suddenly began to cry.

“fascist-parent-level control.” Some of his own proposals go further. On his blog, he once joked about converting San Francisco’s underclasses into biodiesel to power the city’s buses. Then he suggested another idea: putting them in solitary confinement, hooked up to a virtual-reality interface. Whatever the exact solution, he has written, it is crucial to find “a humane alternative to genocide,” an outcome that “achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society) but without any of the moral stigma.” 

(NOTE: ATWA / Manson Family belief that there needed to be a global genocide to heal Mother Earth:
ATWA (an acronym for Air, Trees, Water, Animals and All The Way Alive) is the ecological belief system propounded by Charles Manson, who was later convicted of conspiracy to commit murder as the leader of the communal Manson Family. ATWA names the interrelated life-support systems of the Earth. Manson and his associates, most notably Lynette Fromme and Sandra Good, use the term to name the forces of life which they believe hold the balance of the Earth.)
For every seductive & exotic idea /  belief system there needs to be a counterbalancing idea /  belief system ***
Not to neutralize the idea, belief system or ideology, but to generate friction to arrest & abate cultural and social stagnation and produce new ideas from the amplification and destruction of the conflicting ideas (negative & positive feedback)

The story is just real life 
Enemy > hero 
Hero > enemy 
Enemy = hero 
Hero = enemy 
Different combinations and synthesis of different ideologies / belief systems to construct narratives that are active in the world / in play - to create new forms of meaning

“Unless we can totally reëngineer DNA to change what a human being is, there are many people who should not live in a modern way but in a traditional way,” he concluded. “And that is a level of revolution that is so far beyond anything the Trump-Vance regime is doing.”

 “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.”

[...]

once upon a time, people knew their place and lived in harmony; then along came the Enlightenment, with its “noble lie” of egalitarianism, plunging the world into disorder.

Yarvin often criticizes academics for treating history like a Marvel movie, with oversimplified heroes and villains, but it’s unclear what he adds to the picture by calling Napoleon a “startup guy.” (He has favored the revisionist theories that Shakespeare’s plays were really written by the seventeenth Earl of Oxford and that the American Civil War, which he calls the War of Secession, worsened living conditions for Black Americans.)

As Yarvin gazed at the patchwork of neatly tended fields below, he spoke about the Great Replacement as “one of the greatest crimes” in history. “Is it greater than the Holocaust? I don’t know. . . . We haven’t seen it play out yet.” He’d been drinking since his arrival and seemed to be in an emotional state. “I have three children,” he told Camus. “Will they be basically lined up and marched into mass graves?” They had been discussing Jean Raspail’s apocalyptic novel, “The Camp of the Saints” (1973), which depicts an invasion of Indian migrants destroying European nations. Sobbing now, he continued, “I want my children to die in the twenty-second century. I don’t want them to experience some kind of insane post-colonial Holocaust.”

Ai voice in Tehran:

a robotic female voice answered instead.

“Alo? Alo?” the voice said, then asked in English: “Who is calling?” A few seconds passed.

“I can’t heard you,” the voice continued, its English imperfect. “Who you want to speak with? I’m Alyssia. Do you remember me? I think I don’t know who are you.”

Five experts with whom the AP shared recordings said it could be low-tech artificial intelligence, a chatbot or a pre-recorded message to which calls from abroad were diverted.

“Calling your mom and expecting to hear her voice and hearing an AI voice is one of the most scary things I’ve ever experienced,” she said. “I can feel it in my body.”

When she last spoke to her family in Iran, they were mulling whether she should evacuate from the city. Then the blackout was imposed, and they lost contact. Since then she has heard through a relative that the woman was in the ICU with respiratory problems.

When she calls, she gets the same bizarre message as the woman in the U.K., a lengthy mantra.

“Close your eyes and picture yourself in a place that brings you peace and happiness,” it says. “Maybe you are walking through a serene forest, listening to the rustle of leaves and birds chirping. Or you’re by the seashore, hearing the calming sound of waves crashing on the sand.”

The only feeling the message does instill in her, she said, is “helplessness.”

The Suck House:
- Barb just escaped some freaky Nigerian-run slave camp situation — completely insane.  
- These Nigerian operators are running a massive Social Security and illegal immigration scam in California.  
- They buy up cheap houses, convert them into “independent living” care homes.  
- One woman has legal residency and a nursing license — she fronts the operation.  
-Behind her: a Zionist Nigerian church (like Black Hebrew Israelites, but Africans who hate African Americans and are pro-slavery) funneling undocumented immigrants, producing fraudulent papers, fake licenses.  
- They get state disability clients placed in these homes — $2,000/month per person.  
- But the care is fake.  
- Residents are locked in, neglected, abused. Covered in piss and shit.  
- Barb was in one of these houses with four other men — trapped.  
- The house was pulling in $20,000/month for this woman.  
- Barb’s family called the police.  
- Cops showed up, did nothing.  
- Social worker came, looked around, said: “All I can do is call an Uber.”  
- She did. Barb took the Uber back to Burlingame.  
- That was two weeks ago.  
- When I was working night shift as an EMT, I got called to places like this all the time.  
- It’s rampant in California. Everyone knows.  
- Cops won’t touch it.  
- Social workers can’t stop it.

Douthat: Should the human race survive?

Thiel: Yes.

Douthat: OK.

Thiel: But I also would like us to radically solve these problems. And so it’s always, I don’t know, yeah — transhumanism. The ideal was this radical transformation where your human, natural body gets transformed into an immortal body. And there’s a critique of, let’s say, the trans people in a sexual context, or, I don’t know, a transvestite is someone who changes their clothes and cross-dresses, and a transsexual is someone where you change your, I don’t know, penis into a vagina. And we can then debate how well those surgeries work. But we want more transformation than that. The critique is not that it’s weird and unnatural, it’s: Man, it’s so pathetically little. And OK, we want more than cross-dressing or changing your sex organs. We want you to be able to change your heart and change your mind and change your whole body.

And then Orthodox Christianity, by the way — the critique Orthodox Christianity has of this, is these things don’t go far enough. That transhumanism is just changing your body, but you also need to transform your soul and you need to transform your whole self. And so ——

[...]


Douthat: I think it is not — in its current form.

Thiel: I want to say it’s the only thing people still believe in in Europe. They believe in the green thing more than Islamic Shariah law or more than in the Chinese Communist totalitarian takeover. The future is an idea of a future that looks different from the present. The only three on offer in Europe are green, Shariah and the totalitarian communist state. And the green one is by far the strongest.

Douthat: In a declining, decaying Europe that is not a dominant player in the world.

Thiel: Sure. It’s always in a context.

We had this really complicated history with the way nuclear technology worked, and — OK, we didn’t really get to a totalitarian, one-world state. But by the 1970s, one account of the stagnation is that the runaway progress of technology had gotten very scary, and that Baconian science ended at Los Alamos.

And then it was: OK, it ended there, and we didn’t want to have any more. And when Charles Manson took LSD in the late ’60s and the murders started, what he saw on LSD, what he learned was that you could be like an antihero in a Dostoyevsky book and everything was permitted.

Of course, not everyone became Charles Manson. But in my telling of the history, everyone became as deranged as Charles Manson and the hippies took over ——

Douthat: But Charles Manson did not become the Antichrist and take over the world. We’re ending in the apocalyptic, and you’re ——

Thiel: But my telling of the history of the 1970s is the hippies did win. We landed on the moon in July of 1969, Woodstock started three weeks later and, with the benefit of hindsight, that’s when progress stopped and the hippies won. And yeah, it was not literally Charles Manson ——
