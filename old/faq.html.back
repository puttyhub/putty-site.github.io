            building custom image generation models involves four core steps.
	    <br><br>
	    first, a one-on-one consultation. here, we showcase our image generation application, discussing its scope and capabilities. we delve into your project, encouraging you to bring reference materials - your artwork, images, concepts, styles, or objects you're interested in incorporating into the model. we'll then craft a plan for your unique model.
	    <br><br>
	    second, dataset construction. we use your images and our datasets for fine-tuning. this involves image captioning and data cleaning. with your approval, we proceed.
	    <br><br>
	    third, fine tuning. using our custom algorithms, we develop models aligned with your artistic vision.
	    <br><br>
	    fourth, evaluation. after training, we conduct extensive tests and generate diverse outputs. you, the artist, are then involved in the evaluation process.
	    <br><br>
	    upon completion, we provide you with the custom model and datasets, granting you full ownership of your custom models.

        <h2>what is image generation?</h2>
	<h3>at putty-ai, we harness ai technology rooted in latent diffusion. the term ai, often misunderstood, leads to confusion about the technology's core.<br><br> in image generation, prevalent tools utilize a process centered around denoising static images. this involves neural network architectures designed to denoise, similar to clearing tv static. these networks take the static and, through finely tuned models, transform it into images that align with your artistic vision.</h3>
